# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors.

When creating a new appointment, the user can enter any student name while the interviewer is chosen from a predefined list.
The user can save, edit, or delete the appointment and view the entire schedule of appointments on any day of the week.
